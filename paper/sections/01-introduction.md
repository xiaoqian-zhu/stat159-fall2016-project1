The goal of this project assignment is to practice with the computational tools covered so far in the course: bash, Markdown, Pandoc, Git, Github, Make and MacVim, the text editor I chose. Specifically, I am writing a paper about such tools, that commenting on the tools I am using to accomplish this task and what is the role that each tool plays in process of doing a reproducible data science project. Moreover, I am going to describe my own experience of using each tool in this project, including the difficulties I have encountered, the “easy” parts and the most time consuming part. This can also be used as reference material for myself later in the future in order to remember how I did each step.  Moreover, this report is also good references for both who are already somewhat experienced in making reproducible projects and the less experienced.
