##03-Conclusion  


This project took me about 15 hours to complete. Setting up the file structure and writing Makefile took me about 2 hours in total, the rest of the time I am browsing the course website, writing this report and formatting each section. The most challenging part I think is writing Makefile, which I asked my GSI in discussion section several times in order to write each rules correctly. The rest part, I relied on the course website to review the introduction, background and the tutorials of each tool, and writing the report independently. Writing in the markdown file is both the easiest part and the most time consuming part, that the formatting is straightforward but describing the experience needs hours sitting in the library and typing. Finally, there are some lessons that I have learnt when doing this project:  

- It is necessary to have a file structure before doing anything, without a nice file structure, it is hard to doing things smoothly and organized. 
- Using an online Markdown editor is very very very very helpful, which can show me the effects and tell me if I am doing it right when formatting the text, before I type into Vim. It helps me to correct many mistakes and also saves my tons of time. 
- Asking GSI whenever encounter a difficulty. GSI can help me to find out the bug and also teach me about how to write correct codes.
- Committing to Git frequently also helps a lot, that when I screw things up or lose files, I can easily recover. 
- Automating the creation of the final paper via Makefile is really useful that I tested several times to see the final product. Make helps to automate the testing process, and saves me time of doing unnecessary recompiling. I only need to run `make` in the terminal window, and then the testing is done.
